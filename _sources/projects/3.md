# Project 3

In this project, you will leverage Vue.js to create a dynamic and interactive beverage component. The goal is to implement a versatile component that allows users to customize their beverage by selecting various options for creamers, syrups, and base beverages.

## Objectives

- **Conditional Rendering:** Utilize Vue's conditional rendering capabilities to dynamically display beverage components based on user selections.
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Implement two-way data binding to ensure seamless updates between the user interface and the application state.
- **Vue 3 Components with Properties:** Create Vue 3 components that accept properties, enabling parent components to pass data to child components efficiently.
- **Slots:** Use Vue's slot system to create flexible and reusable component templates.

## Preparation

1. Accept your instructor's [GitHub classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/LBCrcpys) to set up your project repository.

   1. **Select Your Name:** ![select-name](../assets/img/project1-selectname.jpg)
   2. **Team Setup:**
      1. If your team does not exist yet, create a new team.
      2. If it already exists, join your existing team. !
   3. **Initialize Your Project Repository:**
   4. **Clone the Repository:** You're now ready to clone the repository. In your `terminal`, use the following command with your SSH repository link to download the repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone [YOUR_SSH_REPO_LINK]
      ```

   5. **Install Required Packages:** Execute the following command to install the necessary packages for your project:

      ```bash
      cd [YOUR_REPO]
      npm install
      ```

2. Run a local development server (default port 5173):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then you can access your project at `localhost:5173` in browser.

## Instructions

In this project, you will develop a Beverage Vue Application. Your objective is to enhance the application with additional choices and functionalities as described below:

1. Expand the selection options in the `App.vue` to include more varieties of creamer, syrup, and base beverages for customers to choose from:

   - Creamer: None, Milk, Cream, Half & Half
   - Syrup: None, Vanilla, Caramel, Hazelnut
   - Base Beverage: Coffee, Green Tea, Black Tea ![Layout](../assets/img/project3-beverage1.jpg)

2. Update the `Base.vue`, `Creamer.vue`, and `Syrup.vue` components to dynamically change styles based on the customer's selections.
3. Update the Beverage.vue to ensure

   - Add properties that allow the parent component to pass the customer's choices of creamer, syrup, and base beverage.
   - Implement conditional rendering to ensure logical display behavior:
     - Display only the base beverage in the mug if the customer selects "None" for both Creamer and Syrup.
     - When "None" is selected for Syrup but not for Creamer, display the creamer directly on top of the base beverage without any gap. ![Layout](../assets/img/project3-beverage2.jpg)
