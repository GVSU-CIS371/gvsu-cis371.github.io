# Brew & Save

In this homework, you will extend your previous project Custom Drink Maker by building a new version with enhanced state management and user interaction. The goal is to implement a feature that allows users to create, name, store, and visualize their own beverage recipes using Pinia.

## Objectives

- **Pinia Integration:** Implement Pinia to manage and store the state of user-created beverage recipes.
- **User Interaction:** Enhance the user interface to allow users to create and view beverage combinations easily.

## Instructions

Accept your instructorâ€™s [GitHub Classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/nBu_5vkw) to create your project repository.

1. **Project Initialization:**  
   Copy all necessary code (excluding `beverage.ts`) from your previous homework **"Custom Drink Maker"** into the `src/` folder to ensure that all components function correctly and beverages are rendered as expected.

2. **Pinia Store Integration:**  
   Complete the Pinia store file `beverageStore.ts` under the `stores/` directory.

   - Import ingredient data (bases, creamers, syrups, and temperatures) from the `data/` folder.
   - This store should manage the application state, replacing the logic previously implemented in `beverage.ts`.
   - The store must also support temporarily saving all user-created beverage recipes.

3. **Interface Enhancement:**  
   In `App.vue`, add a text input labeled `"Name"` and a button labeled `"Make Beverage"`.

   - Implement a `makeBeverage()` action in the Pinia store.
   - Bind this action to the `"Make Beverage"` button so that when clicked, it creates a new beverage recipe using the current selections and stores it in the `beverageStore`.

4. **Display Recipes:**  
   Inside the `<div id="beverage-container">`, display a list of all saved beverages from the `beverageStore`.
   - Each beverage should be shown as a clickable button or radio input with its corresponding name.
   - Implement a `showBeverage()` action in the store to update the mug display according to the selected beverage.
   - When a beverage name is selected, this mug should reflect the chosen beverage.

## Expected Outcomes

Focus on implementing the functionalities; the aesthetic design of the radio button list, text box, and button is secondary.
