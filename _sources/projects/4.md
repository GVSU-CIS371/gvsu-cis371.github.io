# Project 4

In this project, you will build based on Project 3 Beverage-App. The main goal is to complete the app by creating a feature that allows users to concoct their own beverage recipes and then store them using Pinia.

## Objectives

- **Pinia Integration:** Implement Pinia to manage and store the state of user-created beverage recipes.
- **User Interaction:** Enhance the application interface to allow for more interactive and user-friendly recipe creation and selection.

## Solution for Project 3

Access the resources for Project 3 solution here: [Source Code](https://github.com/GVSU-CIS371/w24-project4)

## Instructions

Continue working on your project3 Beverage-App to enhance the application with additional choices and functionalities as described below:

1. **Pinia Store Integration:** Create a Pinia store to manage the state of the application, specifically to store the user's beverage selections (temperature, creamer, syrup, base beverage) as named recipes temporarily.
2. **Interface Enhancement:** In App.vue, add a text input field labeled "Name" and a button labeled "Make Beverage". Bind the button with a click event that uses the $patch method to add the user's selections as a named recipe in the Pinia store.
3. **Display Recipes:** Show all the recipes currently stored in the Pinia Store In App.vue. Implement a click function, showBeverage, to allow users to click on a recipe name, which will then visually display the corresponding beverage in the mug.

## Expected Outcomes

Focus on implementing the functionalities; the aesthetic design of the radio button list, text box, and button is secondary.
