# CIS 371 Term Project Details

## Objectives
The term project is designed to:
- Demonstrate mastery of skills learned in the course.  
- Provide experience building and presenting a moderately large web application.  
- Encourage teamwork and consistent development practices.  

You will work in groups of 2–3 students. Each group will design and implement a **web application** (not just a static web page) that is practical and original. The project should include key features expected in real-world applications and must be deployed with a functioning cloud backend.

## Project Requirements
Your web application must demonstrate the following:

1. **Project Proposal**  
   - Submit a one-page proposal early in the semester.  
   - The proposal should include:  
     - Overview of the application.  
     - Problem solved and uniqueness.  
     - Potential users.  
     - Team responsibilities and role distribution.  
     - Database design (collections/tables, attributes).  
     - Any planned external services.  

2. **Complete & Realistic Features**  
   - Functional features that reflect real-world app behavior.  
   - Example: a shopping app should include cart and checkout.  

3. **User Authentication**  
   - Implement a secure login/logout system.  
   - Support multiple concurrent users.  

4. **Cloud Database**  
   - Use Firebase Cloud Firestore.  
   - At least two or three collections (depending on group size).  
   - Must support both private (user-specific) and shared data.  

5. **Database Operations**  
   - Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.  

6. **Frontend Framework**  
   - Use Vue.js (preferred) or a comparable modern frontend framework.  

7. **Visual Design**  
   - Apply CSS or UI frameworks (e.g., Vuetify, Bootstrap) for a responsive, professional look.  

8. **Version Control & Progress**  
   - Maintain the project in a Git repository.  
   - Commit regularly to demonstrate consistent progress by all team members.  

9. **In-Class Presentation**  
   - Each group will present their project in class.  
   - All members must participate.  
   - A live demo is required.

## Deliverables
1. **Proposal Document** (one page).  
2. **Deployed Web Application** with a publicly accessible URL.  
3. **Git Repository** with full source code and commit history.  
4. **In-Class Presentation** and live demo.
