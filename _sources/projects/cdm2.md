# Custom Drink Maker 2

In this homework, you will build based on homework, Custom Drink Maker. The main goal is to complete the app by creating a feature that allows users to concoct their own beverage recipes and then store them using Pinia.

## Objectives

- **Pinia Integration:** Implement Pinia to manage and store the state of user-created beverage recipes.
- **User Interaction:** Enhance the application interface to allow for more interactive and user-friendly recipe creation and selection.

## Instructions

Accept your instructorâ€™s GitHub classroom invitation to set up your project repository. Copy necessay code for to the src folder from you homework "Custom Drink Maker", enhance the application with additional choices and functionalities as described below:

1. **Pinia Store Integration:** Create a Pinia store to manage the state of the application, specifically to store the user's beverage selections (temperature, creamer, syrup, base beverage) as named recipes temporarily.
2. **Interface Enhancement:** In App.vue, add a text input field labeled "Name" and a button labeled "Make Beverage". Bind the button with a click event that uses the $patch method to add the user's selections as a named recipe in the Pinia store.
3. **Display Recipes:** Show all the recipes currently stored in the Pinia Store In App.vue. Implement a click function, showBeverage, to allow users to click on a recipe name, which will then visually display the corresponding beverage in the mug.
