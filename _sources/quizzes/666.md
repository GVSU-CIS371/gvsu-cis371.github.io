# Quiz 6 Vue 3 and Pinia Basics

In this quiz, you will build on your understanding of Vue 3 and Pinia by adding functionality to a **User Management** project.

---

Given a starter project with a basic UserStore and a list of random users [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-rrzxb2?file=src%2FApp.vue,src%2Fstores%2FUserStore.ts).

1. Delete User

   - Add a delete button next to each user in App.vue. When clicked, this button should remove the user from the UserStore. You can implement this using either $patch or an action in UserStore.

2. Automatic Refill When Empty

   - Use $subscribe on the UserStore to monitor the users state.
   - If the users list becomes empty, automatically call the fill action to fetch and refill random users from the Random User API.

3. (extro credit) Add Sorting by First Name

   - In the UserStore, add a getter that returns users sorted by first name.
   - In App.vue, create radio buttons or checkboxes to enable users to toggle sorting on or off by first name.
