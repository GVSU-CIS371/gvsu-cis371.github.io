---

Given the following book array,

```javascript
[
  {
    id: "b1",
    title: "1984",
    author: "George Orwell",
    year: 1949,
    genres: ["Fiction", "Dystopia"],
  },
  {
    id: "b2",
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    year: 1925,
    genres: ["Fiction", "Tragedy"],
  },
  {
    id: "b3",
    title: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind",
    author: "Yuval Noah Harari",
    year: 2011,
    genres: ["History"],
  },
  {
    id: "b4",
    title: "Educated",
    author: "Tara Westover",
    year: 2018,
    genres: ["Memoir"],
  },
  {
    id: "b5",
    title: "Moby Dick",
    author: "Herman Melville",
    year: 1851,
    genres: ["Fiction", "Adventure"],
  },
  {
    id: "b6",
    title: "Brave New World",
    author: "Aldous Huxley",
    year: 1932,
    genres: ["Fiction", "Dystopia"],
  },
];
```

1. Create a `Book.vue` component that receives the following properties:

   - `title` (string)
   - `author` (string)
   - `year` (number)
   - `genres` (array of strings)

   - The component should display the title as a heading (`<h3>`), the author and release year as paragraphs, and the genres as a comma-separated list.

2. Display Books Using `v-for` in `App.vue`

   In `App.vue`, define a list of books using the provided array. Use the `Book.vue` component created in **Q1** to display each book using **v-for**.

3. Filter Fiction Books Using Event Handling

   In `App.vue`, add a checkbox that toggles between showing **only Fiction** books and **all books**. Use event handling to implement this filter, where changing the checkbox will trigger a method to filter the books.
